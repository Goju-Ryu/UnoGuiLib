# UnoGuiLib

**!!! This project is work in progress !!!**  
It is still in its infancy where I experiment with many approaches, and I'm Learning
[compose-jb](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb) along the way. 


## Project Structure
The project is split into two main packages, the [ui/](src/main/kotlin/ui) and 
the [model/](src/main/kotlin/model). 
The ui/ package contains all the composable that describes the ui of game. In model all code exposed 
through the public api is stored. This code may also be used as data representations to be used in the 
ui/ package. 
 
[comment]: <> (Forklar at ui er koden der beskriver ui opbygning og at
 model beskriver hvordan brugeren interagerer med ui)
